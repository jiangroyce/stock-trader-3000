# Stonk Trader 3000
Stonk Trader 3000 is a partial clone of the trading platform "Robinhood". This application combines the intutive user interface of Robinhood with Yahoo Finance's robust dataset and advanced reporting and calculations of other brokerages. I really like Robinhood's simple and fluid UI design but always felt it lacking in important performance calculations that other brokerage sites have. Currently, the application has basic mock trading and watchlist/screener functionality. I am currently working on implementing backtesting and retirement planning features. For the future, I plan on implementing websockets for live data updates as well as some *"quanty"* features such as portfolio optimization and machine learning stock recommendations.
